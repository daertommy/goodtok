Goodtok helps businesses enhance their customer service right from their website. The video application lets customers connect with your staff in real-time. You can integrate this simple and easy-to-use application into any website.

## Architecture

Coming soon.

## Give a star! ‚≠ê

It would mean a lot to me if you could give this project a star. It helps me identify if I'm doing a good job or not. Also, it helps me attract potential contributors and users. üôè

# Installation

I'm aiming to make this as easy as possible to install. I'm working on a docker image allowing you to run this application with a single command. When it is ready, you will be able to run the following command to get started:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The previous command will start the front-office application. You will then be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000 and start sending requests from the client application.

## Usage

In the website where you want to integrate Goodtok, you will need to add the following script tag:

```html
<!-- Goodtok video client -->
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/goodtok?key=Z3RpZD0xMjM0LHNlcnZlcj1hcGkuZ29vZHRvay5pbyxjdXN0b21lcj10b2tlbg==&token=OPTIONAL_CUSTOMER_TOKEN"
>
</script>
<!-- Goodtok video client end -->
```

The key is a base64 encoded value containing the account `id` and `server` of your Goodtok instance. You can generate this value by running the following command:

```bash
echo -n '{"id":"1234","server":"api.yourinstance.com"}' | base64
```

The client will use the default server at `api.goodtok.io` if no server is specified.

The video widget will request an anonymous token from the server if non is provided. The server will generate a token only if the owner of the `id` has enabled anonymous access. The server will return an error if the owner has not allowed anonymous access.

> Remember that enabling anonymous will require you to implement security measures to prevent abuse ‚ö†Ô∏è

A Goodtok token is a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/). Here is an example of the claims for a customer token:

```json
{
  "ref": "customer-agent",
  "domainRef": "goodtok-01",
  "aor": "sip:anonymous@sip.goodtok.io",
  "aorLink": "sip:anonymous@sip.goodtok.io",
  "domain": "sip.goodtok.io",
  "privacy": "PRIVATE",
  "allowedMethods": ["REGISTER"],
  "signalingServer": "wss://sip.goodtok.io:5062",
}
```

> The Front Office application will look similar but has different allowed methods.

## Known Issues

- When running Goodtok without a TLS certificate, you will need to add the following to your browser to allow the camera to work: `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` or equivalent for your browser. This is because the camera will not work on an insecure origin.
